In a continuous integration and development cycle that uses GitHub Actions, workflow files define what happens when your workflow is triggered. Think of the workflow file as a blueprint that establishes structure. The template not only defines how the workflow should run, but also establishes working parameters such as: 

    - the operation system to use on runners
    - programming languages supported
    - instructions to install dependencies

In this exercise, you will become familiar with the workflow files. As you construct your own file, you will also learn about different parts of the template and their purpose. 

By the end of the exercise you will have created a usable workflow file and defined your own workflow for your Probot app.

Let's get started!


Steps:

1. Create a folder in your repository called `.github`.
2. Inside of that folder, create another folder called `workflows`.
3. Create an empty file called `cd-workflow.yml`.

I'll respond in the new pull request when I detect it has been created.
