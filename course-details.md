This Learning Lab is a part of the hands-on activities included in the GitHub Partner Bootcamp.

In this course, you'll find your first instructions in the `README.md`. Following those instructions, you'll configure GitHub and Azure to work together to deploy a **[Probot app](https://probot.github.io/)**.
​
After you follow the instructions in the README, head over to the first issue for further instructions. Then, you can complete the other activities in the pull requests using your local environment, GitHub.com's UI, or even [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)!

We are constantly iterating on this content. If you would like to provide feedback or help improve this course, please reach out to your GitHub Partner Bootcamp contacts.
